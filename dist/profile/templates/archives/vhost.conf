# allocate the combined total of N KB/sec bandwidth to this service,
# all the concurrent users will share this bandwidth pool, so if 10 people download
# at the same time, they get tenth the bandwidth each.
#
# 1000KB/sec constant transfer is equivalent of 2600GB/month transfer.
# At $0.12/GB, that costs about $300/month
