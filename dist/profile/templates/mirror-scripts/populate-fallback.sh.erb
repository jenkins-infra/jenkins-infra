# put the recent files in the fallback mirror (and recent files alone)
# OSUOSL mirror system has a problem in that its behavior is asynchronous,
# meaning we don't know exactly when it starts serving new files. this creates
# a brief time window where files visible from http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/ results in 404
# (because those files aren't yet available from OSUOSL mirrors.)
#
# To prevent this problem, we create a fallback mirror under our control on http://fallback.jenkins-ci.org/
# where we can synchronously push files. Because this fallback mirror is only expected to serve
# very new files, this script only copies those files that are created within last 7 days.
# In this way, we keep the disk consumption in check
